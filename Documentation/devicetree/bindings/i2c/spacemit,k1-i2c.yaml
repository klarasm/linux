  clock-frequency:
    description:
      Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. As only fast and high-speed
      modes are supported by hardware, possible values are 100000 and 400000.
    enum: [100000, 400000]
    default: 100000

  fifo-disable:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Whether to disable FIFO. If FIFO is turned on, it will be interrupted
      only when the FIFO depth is reached, which can reduce the frequency
      of interruption.
    default: false
